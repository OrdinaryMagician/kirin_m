# RED STAR OF INNOCENCE
## UnSX Side Story: Kirin

---

## Really now?

Very much yes. Here's another one but for our precious emperor boy. Fun will be had.

## How did we get to this point?

**Saya** knows full well that **Kirin** has *"real experience"* in the art of war, having participated in various campaigns in his homeworld of **Arkai**, but all those were tales that she didn't get to personally witness...

Therefore, an idea came forth: Have him do some field work in the land of **Cronos**, so **Demo-chan** can have a bit of a break from all the fighting they've been doing for countless years.

And so goes our emperor, with nothing in hand but his wits and his magic. May his adventures serve to make his beloved spouses proud, and for this ravaged world to see peace once more.

## Abilities

As a member of the **Anarukon** race, **Kirin** is completely immortal, and bears strong regenerative power. He will recover health gradually, faster the less damage he's sustained. In addition, he also has a very strong bond with magic, allowing him to cast a variety of spells with ease, and with quite a deep mana pool, as expected of someone so well trained in sorcery.

Apart from these abilities, he's also somewhat skilled at hand to hand combat, as a requirement for self-defense against assassins. He also knows full well how to employ various firearms. Nevertheless, magic is where he shines, so these are mostly complementary.

As **Kirin** has no access to **Hammerspace**, he instead carries all his equipment on his body, thus limiting somewhat how much he can hold. He's got a holster for a handgun, and the other two weapons he chose for his journey have sling attachments. For ammunition and other items he's got a couple pouches and a backpack. **Saya** couldn't stop fawning over how *"tactical"* he looked all suited up. Should also be mentioned that his emperor suit was constructed with armored lining, although it's not enough protection to survive in a serious combat situation.

Should he fall in battle, he will simply get back up again shortly afterwards. Should his body be torn to shreds, his remains shall scatter in the wind and he will be reformed in a safer place, together with all his belongings. Such is the blessing of the **Father of Eternity**.

## Weaponry

There are four weapons available throughout your journey. As this is a mod for **Hexen**, that's very much the "ideal" layout. The only bindings you ever need are both fire buttons, reload and zoom.

### Slot 1 - Unarmed

Fight your enemies with your own body. This shouldn't be very effective considering **Kirin**'s physical form, but it's helpful in a pinch.

Primary fire alternates between two quick jabs and a hook. This has some decent staggering potential, and can quickly push back small foes. Secondary fire opts for a swift side-sweeping kick. This is where **Kirin**'s lower body strength shines, pushing real hard against rows of enemies.

The reload and zoom functions allow you to block and parry respectively. Blocking is mostly effective, thanks to the armored lining of your suit, especially around the cuffs. Parrying, if timed well, will leave an enemy stunned for a short period of time, upon which any damage to them is amplified. It is not possible to parry projectiles, you are not **Demo-chan**, nor know exactly how they can even do such a thing.

### Slot 2 - Nelaka Rykha Semi-Auto

One of the most common **Anarukon** handguns. Firing small 6mm steel bolts, it does not have a lot of killing potential, but then again, it is a weapon designed for civilian self-defense. Putting a couple of these in an enemy will make it topple down in no time, however. Each magazine holds 12 rounds. **Kirin** can carry up to 60 rounds in total.

Primary fire will of course shoot the gun, while secondary lets **Kirin** make use of a certain trick that he learned from his grandmother: Overcharging the internal mana supply of the weapon so its shots are strengthened for a limited time.

Like any **Anarukon** firearm, the weapon not only needs to be reloaded with more bullets, but also have its inner mana supply replenished in order for it to actually fire off rounds. This recharge process is done through the zoom key.

### Slot 3 - Sokana Fragment Carbine

This is basically an over-under shotgun powered by magic, designed by famed gunsmith **Irai Sokana**, grandmother of one of **Kirin**'s maids. Each cartridge comes packed with several iron pellets and a charge of pyromantic salt. **Kirin** can carry up to 30 cartridges in total.

Primary fire shoots the top barrel, while secondary fire shoots the bottom barrel. Due to the employment of solidified pyromantic mana, a potent burst of flame will come out of the barrel with each shot, making shots at point blank deal A LOT of fire damage. Pressing the zoom key toggles a *"linked fire"* mode, where either trigger press will fire both barrels at once.

Unlike other firearms, the use of a physical propellant means that the weapon does not need to be replenished with mana for it to keep operating.

### Slot 4 - Unissix Crafts Warp Ballista

A gift from **Kirin**'s very distant cousin. This beast is effectively an FTL rocket launcher. Due to some specifics of deployment, the weapon had to be delivered in a disassembled state, but the three main parts ended up scattered. **Saya** cites that **Cyrus** may have done it on purpose so the weapon can be *"unlocked in stages"*, which she additionally commented on as being *"some videogamey bullshit"*. Nevertheless, **Kirin** considers that to make the prospect of using it more exciting, as he has a great admiration for **Misa**'s handiwork.

Primary fire will deploy the payload, piercing through everything in its path in the mere blink of an eye. Secondary fire arms the explosive early, causing the projectile to burst upon hitting its first target. Zoom lets you you aim through the scope, for long distance shots.

Ammunition for this weapon can be found sometimes scattered throughout the world, but it's fairly rare compared to that of the other two. Part of the challenge, perhaps. **Kirin** can only carry three rounds for this, due to their size. The weapon itself can hold two in reserve and one in the chamber, adding up to a total of six shots.

## Spellcasting

Of course, **Kirin** knows a wide range of spells that he can make use of at his leisure, should he possess the mana to spare. All of these make use only of the primary and secondary fire buttons.

### Slot 5 - Flame of the Heart

The spell that **Kirin** had learned to impress **Saya** and the girls back when they were first dating. It's proven to be very effective at healing, apart from having a relaxing warmth to it.

Primary fire can be held to cast it within your hands, while secondary fire will instead consume a sizable amount of mana to cast it in the air, as a temporary area of effect heal, allowing you to heal up while having your hands free for handling weapons, or other spells.

### Slot 6 - Ember Flash

A fundamental pyromantic spell, and one that **Kirin** apparently uses very often. Release a burst of flame from your hands, with a lot of kinetic force behind it *(so it can push enemies back)*.

Primary fire shoots out from the left hand, while secondary fire shoots from the right hand.

### Slot 7 - Cryotic Blast

The cryomantic equivalent of the previous spell, also very commonly used. Releases a burst of gelid air from your hands. Both of these spells get a lot of use in pretty mundane tasks, so practically everyone knows how to use them.

Both fire buttons do what you'd expect.

### Slot 8 - Boundary Break

A staple of the **Yanikov** family. Tears open a gap through space-time connecting to a distant spot, allowing you to transport there almost instantly. **Kirin** generally doesn't use it outside of emergencies, as he considers it *"slothful"* to avoid walking by simply tearing through space.

Secondary fire can be held to set up the destination spot. Tapping primary fire will then send you there in an instant. Do note that if you simply tap primary fire by itself, you won't be able to guess exactly where you may land, but it can still be useful to do quick dashes to flee the enemy.

### Slot 9 - Great Discharge

A burst of lightning from your own hands. Can easily stagger enemies while dealing damage over a short period of time. It's proven to be very lethal for anything that's making contact with water (including yourself, so be careful).

Primary fire shoots a straight blast from your hand, while secondary fire charges up a ball lightning that will discharge at its point of impact.

### Slot 0 - Wild Blade

Invoke a blade of verdant wild pyromancy, allowing you to slash at foes with searing acidic fire. This is a spell that **Kirin** personally learned from his good friend **Dread Overlord Nuoma**, conqueror of the ashlands of **Kruon**.

Before anything is to be done, either fire button will first summon the blade, after that, primary fire will perform side swipes, while secondary fire does a thrusting attack. Each of these attacks will release shockwaves, so they're still effective at a short to medium range.

Note that for as long as the blade is active, your mana will slowly drain, so don't keep it out at all times.

## Items

Obviously to aid you in this lone journey, you're going to need some extra help. Various items have been scattered around, as per usual. Your backpack is bigger on the inside thanks to some sneaky **Yanikov** magic, so you can hold plenty of items easily. As **Kirin** is very orderly, he will never waste anything. Excess amounts of items that can't be picked up will be left behind for later. This is especially important for ammunition, of course.

### Candy Bean *[Crystal Vial, Mystic Ambit Incant]*

Each of these regains a bit of health and mana when eaten. Part of his grandmother's seemingly endless supply of sweets. If **Kirin** isn't feeling hungry, he'll save them up for later, eating them one by one by himself when needed. These candies are stored in his pockets, for quick access.

### Refreshing Beverage *[Quartz Flask]*

A popular, sugar-rich drink used mainly by **Anarukon** athletes. Regains some health on use.

### Akashna Extract *[Mystic Urn]*

A refreshing bottle of sweet tea with a pungent odor, made from iron-rich Akashna blood. Greatly boosts regeneration upon consumption, though its full effects fade after a while.

### Ring of Protection *[Amulet of Warding, Falcon Shield, Mesh Armor, Platinum Helm]*

You can carry up to eight of these at the same time, stacking into almost complete invulnerability. They will turn to dust after absorbing too much damage, however. Strangely, you don't need to put these in your fingers for them to have any effect. They'll work as long as you keep them close to your body, so Kirin just keeps them in his chest pocket.

### Ring Set *[Dragonskin Bracers]*

Four rings of protection in one package.

### Red Oni Milk *[Icon of the Defender]*

A flask of **Ibuki**'s own fresh milk. So nutritious it can boost one's defenses to unheard of levels.

### 6mm Short *[Blue Mana]*

Found in bunches of 4 rounds. **Kirin** will skillfully load them into his reserve mags as he picks them up, and leave any excess behind.

### 10mm Frag *[Green Mana]*

Found in pairs of 2 rounds. **Kirin** only grabs what he needs, of course.

### Assorted Ammo *[Combined Mana]*

5 pistol rounds and 3 shells.

### Ammo Pack *[Krater of Might]*

30 pistol rounds and 15 shells in one package, plus a ballista round!

### Small Bomb *[Flechette]*

A gift from **Saya**. Small, but packed with plenty of **Explodium**.

### YEET Mechanism *[Disc of Repulsion]*

Invented by **Saya** to quickly get rid of annoying pests. Shoves away everything around you on use, with great violence.

### Safety Tether *[Chaos Device]*

Yet another gift from **Saya**. She wants to ensure that you don't need to perform a scattering should you ever get caught in an inescapable trap. This device will immediately transport you back to the entrypoint of the current area on use. The design looks oddly familiar, although you can't quite tell why.

### Accelerator Amulet *[Boots of Speed]*

Hastens your stride for a limited time. Appears to also affect the speed of your melee kicks, too.

### Devastation Sigil *[Dark Servant, Banishment Device]*

A gift from **Demo-chan**. Greatly empowers all damage you deal, though this comes at the price of potentially putting yourself in greater danger with your own weapons.

### Enthrallment Solution *[Porkalator]*

Creatures sprinkled with this will abide by your command, turning against your own foes. Does not appear to work on very strong-willed enemies *(that is, bosses)*.

### Pocket Light *[Torch]*

A little flashlight that attaches to your chest pocket. Provides fairly strong illumination, which explains why its battery drains so quickly.

### Aerial Amulet *[Wings of Wrath]*

Allows you to fly about. Its effects can be toggled at will *(do watch out for heights when you do so)*. Due to its fragility, it will shatter should you travel too far of a distance through portals.
